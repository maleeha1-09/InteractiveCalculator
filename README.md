## Drag & Drop Calculator
A simple and interactive calculator that lets you build math problems by dragging and dropping numbers and symbols. It's built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and keeps track of your past calculations.

# Key Features
Easy Input: Drag numbers and operators, or simply click them.

Live Display: Watch your math problem appear as you build it.

Basic Math: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Save & Reuse:

Save your calculations with a title and description.

Drag a saved calculation back into the main area to use it again.

Note: Saved calculations are stored only while the browser tab is open and will disappear when you close or refresh.

Quick Actions: Clear your current problem or delete the last item.

Looks Good Everywhere: Works well on phones, tablets, and computers.

Clean Design: A modern look thanks to Tailwind CSS.

# How It's Built
HTML: For the page structure.

CSS (with Tailwind CSS): For all the styling.

JavaScript: For all the interactive parts (dragging, dropping, calculating, saving).

Get Started
You don't need any special software to run this! Just a web browser.

Steps:
Get the files: Download index.html, style.css, and script.js into one folder on your computer.

(If you use Git, you can git clone https://github.com/your-username/drag-drop-calculator.git)

Open index.html: Double-click this file in your folder. It will open in your web browser.

# How to Use
Build Your Math:

Drag numbers and operators from the left panel onto the middle black display.

Or, just click the buttons on the left.

Get the Answer: Click the "= Calculate =" button.

 # Manage:

"Clear" empties everything.

"Delete" removes the last item you added.

Save Your Work:

Click "Save Calculation" after you get a result.

Give it a name and optional notes.

It will appear in the "Saved Calculations" list on the right.

Use Past Calculations:

Click the blue arrow next to a saved item to load it.

Remove Saved Items: Click the red trash can icon next to a saved calculation.

Things to Note
